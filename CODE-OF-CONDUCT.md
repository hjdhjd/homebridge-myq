# Code of Conduct

By interacting with this GitHub repository, you agree that you'll follow this code of conduct.

### In short: Be nice. Be respectful. No harassment, trolling, or spamming.

Always be mindful that in the free / open source community, people are contributing their time away from friends and families to work on these projects. No one is being compensated for their work here. While feedback is useful, coming to this repository to make demands isnâ€™t respectful.

* Harassment includes sexual language and imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, name-calling, unwelcome attention, libel, and any malicious hacking or social engineering. This repository should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of your background, identity, or experience level.

* Trolling includes posting inflammatory comments to provoke an emotional response or disrupt discussions.

* Spamming includes posting off-topic messages to disrupt discussions, promote a product, solicit donations, advertise a job / internship / gig, or flooding discussions with files or text.

#### The maintainers of this GitHub repository will take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including banning the offender from this repository.
